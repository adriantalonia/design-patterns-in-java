# SOLID Principles

In software development, **Object-Oriented Design** plays a crucial role when it comes to writing flexible, scalable, maintainable, and reusable code. There are so many benefits of using OOD but every developer should also know the SOLID principle for good object-oriented design in programming. The SOLID principle was introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob and it is a coding standard in programming. 

This principle is an acronym of the five principles which are given below:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
2. Open/Closed Principle
3. Liskov‚Äôs Substitution Principle (LSP)
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## [1. Single Responsibility Principle](_01_single_responsability/README.md) üîó
This principle states that ‚ÄúA class should have only one reason to change‚Äù which means every class should have a single responsibility or single job or single purpose. In other words, a class should have only one job or purpose within the software system.

Let‚Äôs understand Single Responsibility Principle using an example:

```Imagine a baker who is responsible for baking bread. The baker‚Äôs role is to focus on the task of baking bread, ensuring that the bread is of high quality, properly baked, and meets the bakery‚Äôs standards.```

* However, if the baker is also responsible for managing the inventory, ordering supplies, serving customers, and cleaning the bakery, this would violate the SRP.
* Each of these tasks represents a separate responsibility, and by combining them, the baker‚Äôs focus and effectiveness in baking bread could be compromised.
* To adhere to the SRP, the bakery could assign different roles to different individuals or teams. For example, there could be a separate person or team responsible for managing the inventory, another for ordering supplies, another for serving customers, and another for cleaning the bakery.
